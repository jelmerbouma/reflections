Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
stay in control

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

fork - creates clone of a repo from git repo to git repo instead of to local working directory - give credit to original repo, continue yourself with your own version
clone - clones a repo to your local machine to work on the code locally
branch - creates new brnanch on a repo - adding feature to repo that you want to group and test separately first before committing to master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you can undo your changes, roll back to previous known state. you can also commit from that stage onwards so git knows which changes to merge.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
