How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    version control, no manual searches, less error-prone, if you make 
    mistake you can go back to a working version quickly, auditing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   cannot forget when auto saved, however, cannot logically group your commits.
   so manually choosing allows you to commit the right changes that belong together
   without creating huge change log.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    separate files can be related, e.g. html and css. java files that are related 
    and need to change at the same time.
    in google docs, usually creating a single file, unrelated to others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    find commit id of the change you're interesed in, then do git diff old version
    new version to compare the 2.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

you can always revert to previous workig version with git checkout to restore previous
version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
